# Edge Computing

## Edge computing – A brief History and its evolution
Edge computing emerged in the 1990s with content delivery networks (CDNs), which reduced latency by caching web content closer to users. In the 2000s, cloud computing centralized data processing, but growing IoT and mobile applications exposed its limitations, such as high latency and bandwidth constraints.

By the 2010s, fog computing and early edge solutions from companies like Cisco and IBM addressed these challenges by bringing computation closer to data sources. Major cloud providers soon integrated edge capabilities. Around the same time, major cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google began integrating edge solutions into their services.

Today, edge computing powers smart cities, autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and 5G networks, enabling real-time analytics and decision-making while continuing to evolve with AI and machine learning advancements. As AI and machine learning advance, edge computing continues to evolve, offering real-time analytics and decision-making at the network's edge, shaping the future of computing.

##  Edge computing in Modern Days

Edge computing is a decentralized IT architecture that processes data near its source, minimizing latency and enhancing efficiency by handling information at the network's edge. The aim of this distributed computing model is to ensure lower latency, greater reliability, and improved efficiency.

Data is the backbone of modern business, driving valuable insights and enabling real-time control over critical operations and processes. The massive surge in data is transforming how businesses approach computing. Traditionally, companies relied on centralized data centres and standard internet connections to process and store information. This model worked well when data volumes were manageable, but it struggles to keep up with the exponential growth of real-time data generated by IoT devices and sensors worldwide.

## Overcoming limitations and addressing issues

The limitations of this traditional approach include bandwidth constraints, high latency, and network disruptions, which can delay critical decision-making and reduce efficiency. Transmitting vast amounts of data to a centralized cloud for processing is not only slow but also costly and impractical for applications requiring real-time insights.

To address these challenges, businesses are adopting edge computing architecture, which processes data closer to its source—at the "edge" of the network. This reduces latency, minimizes bandwidth usage, enhances reliability, and enables faster, more responsive operations. By decentralizing data processing, edge computing ensures businesses can harness the full potential of their data without being hindered by traditional infrastructure bottlenecks. Thus, it makes edge computing essential for modern applications requiring real-time data insights.

A standard edge computing architecture consists of three layers:

**Cloud Layer** – This layer is responsible for storing and processing large volumes of data, handling complex analytics, and managing long-term storage.

**Edge Layer** – Positioned closer to the data source, this layer processes information in near real-time, reducing latency and optimizing performance.

**Device Layer** – Comprising sensors and smart devices, this layer detects data, performs basic processing, and transmits relevant information to the edge or cloud layers for further analysis.

## Real-World Application of Edge Computing
